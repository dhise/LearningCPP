\\Decided to take another crack at it
\\I accepted that if i'm not going to use a while loop I will be okay with multiple lines of the same function while manually putting in the seconds
\\this was much easier and took me about 8 minutes to do this time

#include <iostream>


double getHeight(){

  std::cout << "Enter a height to drop the ball from\n";
  double dropHeight {};
  std::cin >> dropHeight;
  return dropHeight;
}

double ballHeight(double currentHeight, double seconds)
{
  
  currentHeight = currentHeight - 9.8 * (seconds * seconds)/2;
  if (currentHeight < 0)
  {
    std::cout << "Ball is on the ground\n";
    return 0;
  }
  std::cout << "At " << seconds << " seconds the balle is at " << currentHeight << " meters\n"; 
  return currentHeight;
  
}



int main()
{
    
  double currentHeight {getHeight()};
  currentHeight = ballHeight(currentHeight, 0);
  currentHeight = ballHeight(currentHeight, 1);
  currentHeight = ballHeight(currentHeight, 2);
  currentHeight = ballHeight(currentHeight, 3);
  currentHeight = ballHeight(currentHeight, 4);
  currentHeight = ballHeight(currentHeight, 5);
  //currentHeight = 9.8 *(seconds * seconds)/2
  
  return 0;
}
