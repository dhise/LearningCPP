Side project of creating a organism that will need to eat/move/perserve energy and will grow. No plans for any GUI as working with C++ libraries is beyond my ability right now and I'd rather do more with this before trying to get into working with graphics. 
Quickly looked up how to set up classes. Not sure what the difference between classes and structures are. 

Next - Implement a class that represents the base cell so if I spawn more they just pull from that 
Next - Make loop that moves and spends energy and will check for hunger and if hungry threshold is met will begin looking to eat.   Will start with simply while/if loops that will check the literals I put in would like to make weightings that change and shift so it's more pseudorandom
